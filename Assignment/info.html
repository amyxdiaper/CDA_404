            This page is the information regarding my education and qualifications i have recieved to get me where i am today! My IT career began in secondary school where i loved my IT classes and continued it into my GCSE's where i recieved full marks in my exam
            and the second-highest mark in my year for my coursework. This resulted in an A*. I then continued with IT at college as i opted for the couse BTEC National Diploma in IT where i recieved D*D* which is the highest grade achievable. I have
            now continued with IT once again at university doing the course 'Business Information Technology'.
