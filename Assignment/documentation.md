## Introduction / Background 

 In this project, different types of programming language will be used to create a webpage to solve a 'real-world' problem. In this particular
project, a personal portfolio has been made to solve the issue of self-promotion. The website made solves the issue of self-promotion by showcasing
the individuals knowledge and skills in a very accessible way to potential employers/viewers. The issue begings with the difficulty of being able to
find a job easily in the 'real-world'. Many people struggle to find careers they would like or enjoy and also struggle to showcase their skills to
potential employers. 

## Wireframes

There are multiple wireframes for this project as they show the layout of the different pages. It is also a responsive design so the features on
the site will change positions depending on the device it is accessed from. This ensures a good user experience from all platforms when viewing
the site. Wireframes allow a basic layout of all of the pages on the website and give the creator a rough idea of the more detailed plans for the
project.

## Colour choices
The colour chosen for this website are a white backgrounds and light blue details. These colours were chosen because they are very similar to other
online social sites that are used very frequently for most online users. The light blue has a hex value of '#74C5FE' which shows it is a pale blue
colour. The similarity to online social sites was chosen because this will create a sense of similarity to users and hopefully a professional look.

## Accessibility
The website has not been made to W3C standards as no code as been added to read descriptions of pictures or colours and text. However, most browsers 
now have features included to make browsing the internet much easier for those with hearing or sight difficulties. These features include text-to-
speech applications and the option to change the zoom on the page to be read more easily. 

## GDPR

The Data Protection Act 1998:
Data Protection Act Introduction:
The Data Protection Act is a law that was put in place in 1995 but was changed in 1998. This act was made specifically to protect the data/sensitive 
information of those using the online world (especially e-commerce sites). It is made of 8 principles and 3 rights. Within the law, there are 3 categories 
of people. These are the data subject, the data controller and the information commissioner. The data subject is the person the data is stored about, the 
data controller is the person that handles all data about data subjects and the information commissioner is the person that enforces the data protection act. 
The 8 principles are data must:
- Be processed fairly and lawfully
- Be obtained for lawful purposes
- Be adequate and relevant to the purpose of being stored
- Be kept accurate and up to date
- Not be kept for any longer than necessary 
- Be processed within the principles of this act
- Be kept safe and secure
- Be shared only with countries with adequate data protection laws.
The 3 data subject rights are:
- Have the right to view or have a copy of what data is stored about them
- Have the right to object if the data stored causes distress
- Have the right to prevent data being processed for direct marketing.
There are 3 types of people that are exempt from this act. These are: 
- The police
- MI5/MI6 etcâ€¦
- The tax office
These people are exempt because they need to use data about you to do their job. For example, the police or MI5 would need data about you to be able to detain
you if needed. The tax office is exempt as they too need your data to do their job and see who has been paying taxes or not.

The Data Protection Act does not need to be applied to this website because no user data is being collected and the only personal data on the site 
has been opted to be shown by the creator.


## Distance selling
The Online Distance Selling Act is an act that ensures the safe selling and buying between producer and consumer over distant communication. The
website made will follow this act if a user contacts the creator about a quote or idea for a potential viewer. The legislation will be followed by
prices being discussed once contact has been made, as well as all details of the work being made clear and put in writing for both parties to see.
There are no cancellation forms on the website as services would be discussed over one of the communication forms and the option to cancel will definitely
be available to all clients.

## Evaluation
In conclusion, the website made does solve the issue of 'Self-Promotion' because it has been made by the creator for free. This means it is an inexpensive
way to self-promote and gain potential clients to further extend their work and knowledge. This extra work will also hopefully interest potential employers
if they view the website. The website is also a CV for the creator and will certainly stand-out and be an impressive way of applying to a job to show 
potential employers their capabilities. 

During the making of the website, one of the main issues encountered was having to clear the browser cache regularly to ensure the test running of the
website could be done effectively to make sure everything was working as it should. Another issue was getting the pages to link correctly as they
did not link together to begin with. To overcome this problem, the file path was directly copied from the files instead of being typed in manually.

The website was tested on multiple device screens by using the 'inspect' option in Chrome. This option allows the interface to be changed to different 
popular viewing devices and see how the website reacts to this change in screen size. Testing the website using this showed that it responded well and the
width of the text changed depending on the size of the screen. This means that viewers of the website should be able to comfortably view it from any platform.
