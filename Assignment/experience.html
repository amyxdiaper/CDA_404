            <h2>Job Experience</h2>
                <p>Currently, i do not have a huge amount of experience with IT in industry and am trying to gain more experience in this area. Most
                recently, i have been working with a freight forwarding company called Ocean International and i have been using their bespoke system
                too add old paper files onto it. This is part of their new plan to update the company and create an online envrionment for their files.
        
                At home, i have practiced using my skills learnt from my education. This has included the use of HTML, Javascript and CSS. Below is a very
                basic example of javascript.
