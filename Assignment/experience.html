    <h2>Job Experience</h2>
    <p>Currently, I do not have a huge amount of experience with IT in industry and am trying to gain more experience in this area. Most recently, I have been working with a freight forwarding company called Ocean International and I have been using their
        bespoke system too add old paper files onto it. This is part of their new plan to update the company and create an online envrionment for their files. At home, I have practiced using my skills learnt from my education. This has included the use
        of HTML, Javascript and CSS. Below is a very basic example of javascript. I am still getting comfortable with using Javascript and need more practice with it so that in future, i can make more complex webpages or applications. The example shows
        the basic use of functions and calling of functions to produce an output.

    <script type="text/javascript">
        var name;
        var age;
        var yourLocation;

        name = "Amy";

        age = 19

        yourLocation = "Southampton"

        document.write("<p> Your name: " + name + "</p>");
        document.write("<p> Your age: " + age + "</p>");
        document.write("<p> Your location: " + yourLocation + "</p>");
    </script>
